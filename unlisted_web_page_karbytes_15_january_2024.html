On 15_JANUARY_2024 at approximately 6:00AM Pacific Standard Time karbytes ordered a set of three <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-DISC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M_DISC</a> optical "read only" discs (for encoding digital files in a medium which is designed to retain that encoded information in a computer-retrievable format for up to one thousand years) from Amazon dot Com for approximately $40 total (shipping and taxes included with product price).

karbytes (tentatively (*)) intends to burn all existing <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a> content which is currently on the public <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web</a> (i.e. comprising the files which constitute the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>, the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>, and each of the public karbytes-created GitHub repositories featured in the website directory whose directory root is the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY</a> on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) as those files exist at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 15_JANUARY_2024 onto the first two discs and reserving the final disc in that set of three for karbytes content which is published after the aforementioned point in time.

(karbytes was thinking about the volatility of information stored inside of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB flash drives</a> and, also, the implications of there being a perpetually active clock (powered by some oscillating crystal and perhaps some constant small stream of electricity from a micro battery of a capacitor inside of that flash memory's internal solid state electronic circuitry (which presumably means that the device needs to be plugged into a computer relatively frequently in order to keep that clock ticking and, more importantly, all the digital files which are stored on that flash memory device preserved in a computer-readable format (instead of some corrupted file due to hardware issues)))).

(*) The directory whose root is the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_5</a> on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com is intended by karbytes to be finalized and then saved to the first two of three M_DISCs in the aforementioned set of M_DISCs which karbytes purchased today.
