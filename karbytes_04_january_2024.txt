Today at approximately 6:00AM on 03_JANUARY_2024, I misplaced my keychain (which is featured in the image whose web page address is below):

Because I accidentally lost my keychain (which has one of two bicycle U-lock keys on it (and the other key is in my personal storage room which as a "backup")), I decided to take my bicycle inside the DXC5 building instead of chain the bike to the bike rack outside the building.

After work, I biked back to Warm Springs BART station plaza where I thought I might have accidentally left the keychain. I did not see it where I thought I left it. Hence, I checked the inerds of my backpack and found the keychain in my swim trunks pocket (and I was wearing those swim trunks to keep my other clothes dry (and because swim trunks dry faster than those other clothes) while it was raining).

The significance of this story is that having digital files backed up on physical media (such as a USB flash drive or an M_DISC or a computational device's internal data storage hardware) is like having a physical and virtual intermediary. 

(In the previous sentence I meant for the word "virtual" to be synonymous with the word "cyberspace").

If I truly left my keychain at Warm Springs BART station (see the video referenced in the paragraph above this paragraph to see karbytes at that particular BART station plaza on 17_FEBRUARY_2024), a "random" person might have picked it up, plugged it into a computer, and accessed the files which I backed up onto that keychain's flash drive (and, what I was worried about in particular was someone stealing my bank account and debit card information in order to steal my money or commit crimes in my name (arcane legally speaking)).

Unlike the note file I created yesterday (approximately 12 hours ago) named karbytes_03_january_2024.txt), I decided to make this note file which I am writing into existence (and which I am naming karbytes_04_janauary_2024) open to more edits before I classify this file as being in its final draft form.

(What inspired me to write this section of this note is searching through my blog website (which I created and named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) to find that video of me at Warm Springs BART station approximately one year ago and noticing that some of the hyperlink colors on the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_11 are incorrectly color-coded. In particular, those hyperlink colors are supposed to conform to the styling rules specified in the web page named PUBLIC_DOMAIN. I intend to correct any other instances of that particular error type (i.e. karbytes_digital_file_hyperlink _coloring_incorrect) before midnight (i.e. the moment 04_JANUARY_2024 begins for "inhabitants" of the Pacific Standard Time regions) throughout that website, all corresponding GitHub repositories, and that flash drive on my keychain).
