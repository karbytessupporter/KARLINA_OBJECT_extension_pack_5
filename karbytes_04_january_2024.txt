Today at approximately 6:00AM on 03_JANUARY_2024, I misplaced my keychain (which is featured in the image whose web page address is below):

Because I accidentally lost my keychain (which has one of two bicycle U-lock keys on it (and the other key is in my personal storage room which as a "backup")), I decided to take my bicycle inside the DXC5 building instead of chain the bike to the bike rack outside the building. 

After work, I biked back to Warm Springs BART station plaza where I thought I might have accidentally left the keychain. I did not see it where I thought I left it. Hence, I checked the inerds of my backpack and found the keychain in my swim trunks pocket (and I was wearing those swim trunks to keep my other clothes dry (and because swim trunks dry faster than those other clothes) while it was raining).

The significance of this story is that having digital files backed up on physical media (such as a USB flash drive or an M_DISC or a computational device's internal data storage hardware) is like having a physical and virtual intermediary. 

If I truly left my keychain at Warm Springs BART station (see the video referenced in the paragraph above this paragraph to see karbytes at that particular BART station plaza on 17_FEBRUARY_2024), a "random" person might have picked it up, plugged it into a computer, and accessed the files which I backed up onto that keychain's flash drive (and, what I was worried about in particular was someone stealing my bank account and debit card information in order to steal my money or commit crimes in my name (arcane legally speaking)).
