<span style="background:#ffff00">The web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory</a> (of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) has allegedly been finalized by karbytes (and was updated during the time period in which this journal entry was being edited multiple times by karbytes between 12:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 03_JANUARY_2024 and 12:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 05_JANUARY_2024).</span>

Today at approximately 6:00AM on 03_JANUARY_2024, I misplaced <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4/main/karbytes_flash_drive_keychain_27_december_2023.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my keychain</a> (which is featured in the image whose web page address is below):

<a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4/main/karbytes_flash_drive_keychain_27_december_2023.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_4/main/karbytes_flash_drive_keychain_27_december_2023.jpg</a>

Because I accidentally lost my keychain (which has one of two bicycle U-lock keys on it (and the other key is in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_2/main/instagram_karbytes_28_september_2023_part_0.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my personal storage room</a> which as a "backup")), I decided to take <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_0/main/huffy_kids_bike_05_july_2023.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my bicycle</a> inside the DXC5 building instead of chain the bike to the bike rack outside the building.

(karbytes' personal storage space)

((*) perhaps the word "unit" is more appropriate to use in the line of text above than "space" for the reason that unit seems to denote a unique and finite allocation rather than some nebulous, shape-shifting collection of objects)

After work, I biked back to Warm Springs BART station plaza where I thought I might have accidentally left the keychain. I did not see it where I thought I left it. Hence, I checked the innards of my backpack and found the keychain in my swim trunks pocket (and I was wearing those swim trunks to keep my other clothes dry (and because swim trunks dry faster than those other clothes) while it was raining).

The significance of this story is that having digital files backed up on physical media (such as a USB flash drive or an M_DISC or a computational device's internal data storage hardware) is like having a physical and virtual intermediary. 

(In the previous sentence I meant for the word "virtual" to be synonymous with the word "cyberspace").

If I truly left my keychain at Warm Springs BART station (see the video referenced in the paragraph above this paragraph to see karbytes at that particular BART station plaza on 17_FEBRUARY_2024), a "random" person might have picked it up, plugged it into a computer, and accessed the files which I backed up onto that keychain's flash drive (and, what I was worried about in particular was someone stealing my bank account and debit card information in order to steal my money or commit crimes in my name (arcane legally speaking)).

<span style="background:#ffff00">Unlike the note file I created yesterday (approximately 12 hours ago (at the approximate time at which I added this note's plain-text file to GitHub) named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_5/main/karbytes_03_january_2024.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_03_january_2024.txt</a>), I decided to make this note file which I am writing into existence (and which I am naming <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_5/main/karbytes_04_january_2024.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_04_january_2024.txt</a>) open to more edits before I classify this file as being in its final draft form.</span>

(What inspired me to write this section of this note is searching through my blog website (which I created and named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) to find that video of me at Warm Springs BART station approximately one year ago and noticing that some of the hyperlink colors on the web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_11 are incorrectly color-coded. In particular, those hyperlink colors are supposed to conform to the styling rules specified in the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a>. I intend to correct any other instances of that particular error type (i.e. karbytes_digital_file_hyperlink_coloring_incorrect) before midnight (i.e. the moment 04_JANUARY_2024 begins for "inhabitants" of the Pacific Standard Time regions) throughout that website, all corresponding GitHub repositories, and that flash drive on my keychain).

* * *

I noticed what appears to be another example of what karbytes refers to as an error in another one of the "micro directories" which is listed on the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com: the fact that the web page named raw_github_files_directory_INSTAGRAM_SCREENSHOTS_2022_KARBYTES_ANEW and the web page named raw_github_files_directory_INSTAGRAM_SCREENSHOTS_2022_KARBYTES (of the aforementioned website) are both missing a video file depicting approximately ten seconds of riding a BART train from the inside of one of the mostly empty cars while looking out the windows at the surrounding Daly City region during afternoon. I will keep looking for it throughout my collection of web-based data or else I will simply download that video from my Instagram and upload it to the GitHub repository which contains this note (and that repository is associated with the web page named raw_github_files_directory_karlina_object_extension_pack_5 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).

(I noticed another karbytes_digital_file_hyperlink_coloring_incorrect error in the web page named raw_github_files_directory_karlina_object_extension_pack_2 of the aforementioned website).

I found the BART train video (which I am sharing because I want the web page which this plain-text note is an abridged version of to be an immersive museum-like experience which provides glimpses into my life especially as it pertains to commuting via BART and manifesting what I desire to create as a digital content creator):
