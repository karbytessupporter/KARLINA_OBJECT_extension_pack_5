Approximately one week ago, the "break pads" which squeeze against my back bicycle tire when I squeeze the lever which causes the "break pads" to push the back tire against the relatively stationary bike frame got a bit loose such that the back tire "wobbles" in and out of alignment when I ride the bike (and the back tire tends to resist turning unless I apply sufficient weight to the bike pedals while peddling). 

In an effort to fix that issue, I tried fastening the "break pads" together using a piece of a bungee cord which I found lying on the ground while bicycling through the intersection of Fremont Boulevard and South Grimmer Boulevard but the bungee cord did not appear to make a noticeable difference. What did make an (undesired) difference was me attempting to fix the back breaks by accidentally pulling on the cord "too far" such that the lever got pulled out of alignment and now I need to open up the break lever apparatus on the right handle bar of the bike using a correct-fitting screw driver (which may be available at my dad's house or else I'll have to shop around for the bike repair tools I need or else I will take the bike to a specialty bike shop to be repaired by professionals) in order to re-hool the break cord end back onto right break lever. 

There are some other things I've been meaning to buy which I expected to have done by now such as getting a better replacement sleeping bag (because the one I bought approximately three weeks ago somehow disappeared from the top of my backpack where I strapped it on during my commute (from where I work in Fremont to the place I consider to have been my default hangout spot in Dublin) on the BART train and while bicycling and some other gear which would make my outdoor living experience more comfortable. Unfortunately, the past two paychecks (which are issued weekly on Fridays) have not been directly deposited into my Patelco checking account (but I did talk to an Amazon employee support agent via the MyHR section of the Amazon A to Z app today and was told that those two paychecks are being mailed to my home address and that next week's paycheck will be directly deposited into my bank account due to the fact that something other than me removed my direct deposit information from my account (whose discovery compelled me to re-setup that direct deposit information and such changes taking up to 6 days for the system to register). 

(I did notice that Amazon deposited one cent into my Patelco checking account presumably to verify that the direct deposit information is correct).

Anyway, I plan on not making any further edits to this journal entry before I publish it as a plain-text file only (and not also as a corresponding HyperText Markup Language file) and then update my keychain USB flash drive and WayBack Machine copies of the entire body of public domain intellectual property referred to as karbytes (according to the information presented on the web page named ABOUT_KARBYTES on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).
