What appears to be a non-playable character from my point of view at this time may or may not be a playable character from some point of view other than my own. 

From my point of view at this time, I appear to have always been the only playable character I have had playable access to and I still currently appear to be rendering my encompassing universe from that playable character's point of view.

(To be clear, within the context of this article, the term non-playable character refers to what I remember and/or perceive via my sensory organs to be an information processing agent which appears to have a sufficiently similar nervous system to my own nervous system (and the term non-playable character typically refers to some humanoid individual which I perceive or remember perceiving who is not the same humanoid as the playable character I appear to myself to be inhabiting)).

I am not sure whether or not "selves" (or, more colloquially, "souls") other than myself (i.e. what I assume is the only mind to have ever "played" the humanoid avatar  referred to as karbytes (in the public karbytes-created web page named ABOUT_KARBYTES in the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com)) exist or have ever existed or will ever exist at any "location" (i.e. epistemologically solipsistic unto itself) throughout the entire singular all-encompassing multiverse. Hence, I acknowledge that my point of view is epistemologically solipsistic and not necessarily objectively solipsistic. 

(To be clear, I define "epistemologically solipsistic" to refer to a frame of reference which is agnostic about whatever it does not posess knowledge of while having some degree of awareness about the particular qualia which are rendered in its own sensory, memory, or imagination scope).

(By contrast, I define "objectively solipsistic" to refer to a frame of reference which is indistinguishable from whatever else exists throughout the entire singular all-encompassing multiverse).
