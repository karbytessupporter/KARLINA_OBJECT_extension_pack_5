I believe that it is possible to algo

Stem cells incrementally

Software encoding hardware

Evolve to become autotroph and self cloning copies and preservation of internal knowledge 

Less of a burden on pre-cyborg humans

Panpsychism localized consciousness 

Death and decline can be postponed indefinitely 

Solipsism is inescapable (at least as far as I know)

Selfishness people as tools

Hedonism and competition over scarce biologically essential resources
