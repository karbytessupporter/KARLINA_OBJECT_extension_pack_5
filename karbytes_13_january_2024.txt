I believe that it is possible to deploy an algorithm for an indefinitely long time period which allocates physical resources towards sustaining my body and preventing "age related" decline of cognitive, athletic, and perceptive abilities.

(In order to implement what is described in the previous paragraph, it might be necessary for the implementer(s) of that "always approaching immortality" algorithm to travel to different universes (in order to escape one's body being disintegrated by the "heat death" of the current universe as the structures within that universe become less orderly and more entropic as time elapses along that particular universe's "macro timeline") either by traveling through wormholes to "naturally occurring" (or simply "existent") parallel universes or into newly-engineered parallel universes (perhaps by instantiating a cyberspace interface inside of the current universe which transmits information from the current universe into some virtual universe which happens to exist as its own casually independent physical universe which, more or less, mirrors the current universe)).

A human body can be preserved for an indefinitely long time period while being, more or less, in peak health adult condition for that entire time period as a result of incrementally replacing damaged cells in that human body with new functionally identical replacement cells which are derived from an indefinitely abundant supply of genomically identical stem cells.

A spatially, temporally, and energetically finite physical object (which is abstracted as a particular configuration of atoms which each have a nonambiguous element type and unique position in space relative to each of the other atoms in that configuration) can be, more or less, replicated as a virtual object inside of some virtual universe (which can be interacted with by inhabitants of the relatively physical universe which houses the computational hardware which runs the software which causes that virtual universe to be rendered from the perspective of those inhabitants).

The physical hardware (inside of Universe A) which runs a piece of software which substantiates a virtual universe ((named Universe B) which is superficially indistinguishable from Universe A) can be replicated (down to the precision of atoms and perhaps even subatomic particles) as a superficially identical virtual object inside of Universe B (from the perspective of sufficiently complex information processing agent(s) which inhabit Universe B or which indirectly render the "first person" subjective experiences (in the form of a perpetually forward-moving (in time) space-time continuum with exactly one locus of rendering) of a sufficiently complex information processing agent inhabiting Universe B while still inhabiting Universe A (by interacting with Universe B through some computational hardware inside of Universe A which "instantiates" (or renders accissible) Universe B).

I believe that it is possible to algo

Stem cells incrementally

Software encoding hardware

Evolve to become autotroph and self cloning copies and preservation of internal knowledge 

Less of a burden on pre-cyborg humans

Panpsychism localized consciousness 

Death and decline can be postponed indefinitely 

Solipsism is inescapable (at least as far as I know)

Selfishness people as tools

Hedonism and competition over scarce biologically essential resources
