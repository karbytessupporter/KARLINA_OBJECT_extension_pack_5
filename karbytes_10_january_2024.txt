The situation I have been in for almost the entire period I have been either employed or else unemployed during the past five years is almost never having sufficient funds in my bank accounts or in my PayPal balances to afford being able to immediately replace my Android smartphone in case my current Android smartphone gets lost, stolen, or too damaged for me to use.

(I have been using my Android phone to establish a mobile Internet connection to (a) publish digital content like this journal entry on the public World Wide Web, (b) to send and receive phone calls and text messages between my phone number and other phone numbers, (c) to select Amazon FLEX shifts from the Amazon A to Z application or website, (d) to do the majority of my media consumption (through social media platforms, news websites, and blogs), and (e) to set a loud alarm to help wake me up early in the morning or to signal to myself that I am running out of time at whatever "task" I am "residing" in so that I can smoothly transition to the next "task" without feeling that I am "falling behind schedule" (and, if I seem a bit "regimented" in this journal entry, I am merely attempting to make fun of the fact that, according to some people (real or imagined), I am "overly regimented" and hence "should" be forced to under go more "no ops" and not to be so "productivity oriented" and, instead, "just be chill" and "hang out" on the "sidelines" more like "regular people" (especially "their" wimmin) are "supposed to" do almost exclusively).

(I admit that the end part of the previous paragraph of this journal entry is a bit biased, myopic, and denigrating. I decided to include that part anyway because I think it relates to some of the themes which seem to persist throughout my journey towards ever greater autonomy, well-being, and knowledge (because, as I have established for myself is a "life purpose" of believing in the potential for me and other persons to attain immortality (or at least to approach immortality) through technological and metaphysical "workarounds" to what used to seem like more of an insurmountable obstacle to increased longevity and potency (and I find if useful for me to imagine that I am an "undercover" inter-universal being which has temporarily forgotten some of what it normally has access to knowing in order to complete some mission as the humanoid avatar I happen to be "playing" as I write this note)).

(What has been bothering me for the past three days was having my bicycle tire go flat and not being able to ride it while it was cold, windy, and rainy (and my commute time has been lengthened by three to six hours per day given that I default to walking when my bicycle is out of commission). What I "fear" is happening is that "some people" want me to resume driving a car or else being driven by a car so that I do not take up so much of "the" attention and "breathing room" in public spaces which seem to be implicitly reserved exclusively for just "some people" (and men on bikes with no helmets in particular). I suppose also that "those people" (especially their wimmin) prefer that I be forced to look, act, and sound more like a prostitute who is helplessly dependent on men and patriarchal socioeconomic "pressure" to be a good little cuck to the patriarchy and hardly doing anything effortful unless it is to serve "the patriarchy" at the expense of her autonomy, mobility, athleticism, intellectual pursuits, and daresay health and sanity. After all, a woman's brain is shown to shrink substantially in the prefrontal cortex (especially for parts of the brain pertaining to worldly participation and spatial awareness) so that she is better suited for being confined to some cave where she will nurse Baby while the men provide for her and her cub food and protection from intruders (and from her escaping)).

Anyway, I took my battered bicycle to the Trek bicycle shop in Castro Valley to see if I could get the many broken bike parts replaced and was told by a specialist working for that store that the cost of replacing all of those parts would be roughly equal to having to buy a new bike (which means that I would save the mose money and labor costs simply ordering a new bike (which it is damned well time for considering that my current bicycle was slightly too small for me and was made out of cheap Chinese-manufactured parts and sold by Walmart)).

Right now I appear to barely have enough money to order a new (adult) mountain bicycle from Amazon dot Com and to have it delivered (preassumbled presumqbly) to my legal residence address. Within the next three days I expect to get a few hundred more dollars from my paycheck getting directly deposited into my bank account and my mom sending me $100 on Friday. If I wait until then, I might have enough money left over to replace my Android phone right away. Otherwise, I will just have to force myself to stay up all night until I get a new alarm clock device.
