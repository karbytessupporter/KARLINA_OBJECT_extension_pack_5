I noticed that, at approximately 9AM Pacific Standard Time on 29_DECEMBER_2023 (the day I am supposed to get a paycheck from Amazon deposited into my Patelco checking account) my paycheck take-home pay (which is approximately $140 (for approximately 8 hours worked last pay cycle) according to the paycheck statement issued by the Amazon A to Z app) has not yet been deposited (which is unusual considering that all of my other paychecks for this job have been deposited on time).

Today shortly after worm and while sitting in the rain shelter bus stop thing which is located on the northeast side of the building near the associate entrance, I called the Patelco customer service phone number to inquire about the status of my missing paycheck deposit (which I talked about in yesterday's journal named karbytes_29_december_2023_draft.txt). As soon as I did, some 30 - 40 year old looking black guy who I presume works for the company as an associate sat down next to me and immediately proceeded to smoke a cigarette. I suspected he was spying and possibly recording details of my phone call such as my legal name, social security number, and information about my paycheck deposit history.

The Patelco customer service agent said that the paycheck has not arrived on their end but it might later today during the times checks are deposited en masse. 

I have a hunch that I'm going to have to contact management at my company face to face to close this open ticket in their system (which I submitted via the MyHR part of the Amazon A to Z app).

It's been raining off and on since yesterday afternoon and I am planning on going home before dark today to shower and dry my damp clothes. Right now I am sitting in the Panera restaurant in the Pacific Commons shopping center typing this note and drinking a hazelnut flavored hot coffee which I bought here.

I like the nature of the actual "work" I do at my current job (and the job which I have at least one missing paycheck from). I enjoy package handling, the sounds and textures of boxes and packages being manipulated, the beeping of scanning devices, the whirring of conveyor belts, and the cathedral-like monolothic room which houses the entire facility and looks to me like a component of a microchip inside the motherboard of a computer with vehicles entering and exiting the building through ports in a scheduled manner. Hence I will keep showing up for each shift I sign up for (to the best of my ability) until I am either fired or else am offered what I think is a better job for me.
