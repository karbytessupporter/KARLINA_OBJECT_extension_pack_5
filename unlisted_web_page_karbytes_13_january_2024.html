I believe that it is possible to deploy an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">algorithm</a> for an indefinitely long time period which allocates physical resources towards sustaining my body and preventing "age related" decline of cognitive, athletic, and perceptive abilities.

(In order to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implement</a> what is described in the previous paragraph, it might be necessary for the implementer(s) of that "always approaching immortality" algorithm to travel to different <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universes</a> (in order to escape one's body being disintegrated by the "heat death" of the current universe as the structures within that universe become less orderly and more <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entropic</a> as time elapses along that particular universe's "macro timeline") either by traveling through wormholes to "naturally occurring" (or simply "existent") parallel universes or into newly-engineered parallel universes (perhaps by instantiating a cyberspace interface inside of the current universe which transmits information from the current universe into some virtual universe which happens to exist as its own casually independent physical universe which, more or less, mirrors the current universe)).

A human body can be preserved for an indefinitely long time period while being, more or less, in peak health adult condition for that entire time period as a result of incrementally replacing damaged cells in that human body with new functionally identical replacement cells which are derived from an indefinitely abundant supply of genomically identical <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells</a>.

A spatially, temporally, and energetically finite physical object (which is abstracted as a particular configuration of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atoms</a> which each have a nonambiguous element type and unique position in space relative to each of the other atoms in that configuration) can be, more or less, replicated as a virtual object inside of some virtual universe (which can be interacted with by inhabitants of the relatively physical universe which houses the computational hardware which runs the software which causes that virtual universe to be rendered from the perspective of those inhabitants).

<span style="background:#ffff00">The physical <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardware</a> (inside of Universe A) which runs a piece of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software</a> which substantiates a virtual universe ((named Universe B) which is superficially indistinguishable from Universe A) can be replicated (down to the precision of atoms and perhaps even subatomic particles) as a superficially identical virtual object inside of Universe B (from the perspective of sufficiently complex <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent(s)</a> which inhabit Universe B or which indirectly render the "first person" <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subjective</a> experiences (in the form of a perpetually forward-moving (in time) space-time continuum with exactly one locus of rendering) of a sufficiently complex information processing agent inhabiting Universe B while still inhabiting Universe A (by interacting with Universe B through some computational hardware inside of Universe A which "instantiates" (or renders accessible) Universe B).</span>

<a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panpsychism</a> is an ontological assumption that all of reality is contained inside of exactly one ubiquitous mind (which implies that all phenomena are fundamentally imaginary irregardless of structural complexity and stability of identity).

If what panpsychism posits is true, then pure nothingness is identical to pure consciousness (and pure consciousness is the irreducible and universal building block of all physical and virtual objects and of their encompassing environments).

If panpsychism is true, then what I (i.e. karbytes) fundamentally is (apart from appearing to itself to be a spatially, temporally, and energetically finite information processing agent which takes the form of a single adult humanoid organism) is consciousness itself (either the entire all-encompassing substrate referred to as pure nothingness or else some relatively finite (i.e. non ubiquitous (multiversally)) allocation of pure nothingness which may be able to sustain my continuity of subjective experience (which karbytes renders) between separate life times. In other words, my body might possibly be just a shell for temporally constraining the particular allocation of pure consciousness I am (which means that it might be possible for me to travel out of one body and into another body or to remain relatively formless and, hence, relatively non-localized and potentially non-singular).
